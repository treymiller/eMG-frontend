eMailGrouper will be free for everyone during the Beta period.

When we launch, you'll get unlimited groups for 3 months, and 3 groups free forever. At the end of your 3-month trial, you can either reduce your groups down to the 3 you love the most, or start paying $3 per month to unlock unlimited groups.

eMailGrouper is not an email marketing platform, or another tool for blasting thousands of emails out to big groups of people. There are a number of platforms out there that solve these problems pretty well. eMailGrouper is a frictionless way to interact with real-world groups of people that you know and interact with personally.
