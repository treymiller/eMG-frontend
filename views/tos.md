When you see "we" or "us," we are talking about eMailGrouper. If you're using our service, you need to adhere and understand to the following few points:

No malicious use - You should only use the service in an innocuous way. It's fine to try new things and test the system, but you shouldn't be trying to find vulnerabilities, or use the service for a bad intent. If you don't want it happening to your mother, don't do it with our service. Don't forget, local and federal laws still apply, so don't break the law, either. This also means no spam.

Our machines see your email. It has been said that a machine reading your email is like a dog seeing you naked. Realistically, it's nothing to worry about. The content of the emails is read by our server, but not by humans. Email correspondence has never been secure, so our service should not be used for critical or secret information.

If we change the terms, we'll let you know via email. It is your choice to continue using the service. Using the service is your way of saying that you're okay with our terms of service.

We'll work hard to make sure things don't go wrong--but they could. We make no guarantee that the service will work all the time, everytime.

eMailGrouper isn't liable for any issues it causes. Things go wrong, but we'll try our best to fix them as soon as possible.

We're not a mass marketing platform. We try to facilitate discussion groups via email. Your group can't exceed 50 people. If you believe this is a limitation and you have a ligimate reason why you need more than 50 people, then email us and we'll talk. Don't get us wrong, though: eMailGrouper can be used for small newsletters.
