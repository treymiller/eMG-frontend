We're currrently in Private Beta, which means our features are changing every day. We can't promise 99.99% uptime yet, and our terms of service are subject to rapid change. As a Private Beta user, you're like a cherished guinea pig. You're **cherished**, because without your use and feedback, we'd have no validation that we're moving in the right direction. You're a **guinea pig** because you're helping us in this experimental phase by letting us know when we've broken something.

When you see "we" or "us," we are talking about eMailGrouper. If you're using our service, you need to adhere and understand the following few points:

1. No malicious use. You should only use the service in an innocuous way. It's fine to try new things and test the system, but you shouldn't be trying to find vulnerabilities, or use the service with ill intent intent. If you don't want it happening to your mother, don't do it with our service. Don't forget, local and federal laws still apply, so don't break the law, either. This also means no spam. We reserve the right to disable or delete your account if you violate this rule.

2. Our machines see your email, but only in the way that dozens of other machines see your email between your inbox and youre recipients'. Your email content passes through our server, but in front of human eyes. Public Service announcement: Unencrypted email correspondence has never been secure, so you shouldn't use our service or any one else's to transmit critical or confidential information.

3. If we change the terms, we'll let you know via email. It is your choice to continue using the service. Using the service is your way of saying that you're okay with our terms of service.

4. We'll work hard to make sure things don't go wrong--but they could. We make no guarantee that the service will work all the time, everytime. During the Beta period, we're going to BCC you on every message you initiate to your group, so that you get a confirmation that the message went through. 

5. eMailGrouper isn't liable for any issues it causes. Things go wrong, but we'll try our best to fix them as soon as possible.

6. We're not a mass marketing platform. We try to facilitate discussion groups via email. Your group can't exceed 50 people. If you believe this is a limitation and you have a ligimate reason why you need more than 50 people, then email us and we'll talk. Don't get us wrong, though: eMailGrouper can be used for small newsletters.
