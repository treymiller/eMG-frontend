You can manage every aspect of your groups, and even create a new group, right from your inbox. Here's how:

First, create a new message with your group's name in the To: field. Next, add one of the following commands to the Subject line and hit send:

? or help - returns an email to you with a full list of these Subject Line Commands

@ or echo - returns an email to you with your group name in the Subject line and Group Members in the Body...in case you ever forget who's in the group.

\+ or add PLUS one or more email addresses in the body field adds these addresses into your group.

\- or remove PLUS one or more existing group members' email addresses in the body field removes these addresses from your group.
