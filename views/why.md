Does anyone really need a **new** way to communicate with their friends, co-workers, book club, or classmates?

No. But we all need a **better** way. Instead of joining yet another social media platform, installing a new app, or learning a whole new website to navigate, what if you could just keep using the Inbox and Address Book you already have?

If you've ever:

1. tried to start a **Facebook** group for your Book Club, only to discover that one of the members doesn't have a facebook account
1. set up a group for your fraternity brothers in **Outlook** (or **Gmail**, or **Mac Mail**, or **Mutt**...), only to discover it isn't accessible from your **iPhone** (you have noticed this, haven't you? If not, drop what you're doing and go check!)
1. **manually typed** 10 addresses into an email to your Thursday night poker group, only to discover that one of the addresses you used was outdated, or (worse yet!) you accidentally invited the Most Annoying Guy in the World and there's no way to uninvite him
1. communicated with your Board of Directors by **scrolling through your Inbox** looking for the last message you sent them, hitting "**Reply All**", deleting the old Subject, typing a new subject, deleting the old Body, typing a new body, making sure your signature gets re-added because you probably deleted it by accident...

Then you're going to love eMailGrouper. With our service, you'll:

1. sign up for an account in two steps, then name your first group.
1. add members to your first group right from your Inbox - Mac or PC, Gmail, Outlook, Mac Mail, even right from your iPhone or iPad - by sending your first email to your new eMailGrouper group and CCing your members. This will be the last time you ever have to type all their addresses out!
1. do everything else from your Inbox - add members, remove members, query our system to remind you who the members are, even create New Groups!
1. keep all your groups in sync across all your devices, using the Address Book you already have, with iCloud, Exchange, Google, etc. working behind the scenes.

**Best of all, your group members never need to sign up for anything.**

In fact, if they're not paying really close attention, they may never notice you've started using eMailGrouper...and that's our goal: super-easy for Group Owners, totally transparent for Group Members.

Best of all, you're going to have 3 months to try all this out for free. If you love what we do, then you can keep using 3 of your groups for free forever, or start paying $3/mo. for unlimited groups.
