Does anyone really need a new way to communicate with their friends, co-workers, book club, or classmates?

No. But we all need a better way. Instead of joining a new social media platform, installing a new app, or learning a new workflow, what if you could just use the Inbox and Address Book you already have?

You're already thinking "But I already have a bunch of groups in Outlook (or Mac Mail, or Gmail, or Mutt). Why can't I just send emails to to my groups from there?" Well, those groups are fine, as long as you don't need to access them from your iPhone or iPad...your groups are inaccessible.

With eMailGrouper, a group owner can create a new list in two steps and manage everything else - adding members, removing members, creating new groups - from the Inbox he already has. Group members never need to sign up for anything. They just keep checkng their Inbox, and hit reply when they want to.

Easy for group owners: sign up in two steps, and you're off and running.

Easy for group members: they may never know you're using our platform!
